## what up dr. lu! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Ž
thanks for giving us an intro to git today. i enjoyed learning about the differences between git and github as well as examining how git is
typically used in the computing industry. i can see why a proficiency in git is necessary for being an effective collaborator in senior project.

looking forward to learning more about software engineering philosophy and getting started on our projects!

hope you're having a great week,<br>drew ross the computer boss ðŸ¤–
